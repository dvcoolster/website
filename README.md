#### A better leader
My first principle approach to becoming a better leader pursued towards communication being a key.

**What if you could always tell anyone your thoughts very easily?**
Everything in life we see around are perspectives, those who hate or hurt us also have their complete fulfilling logics which
they use. Do not think that the person who's actions hurt is evil, if only there was a way we could all see and feel each other's
thoughts. I'll go on a limb and say if you can understand someone's complete thoughts, you might even fall in love with them.

Forget about someone else if only you could understand all of your own thoughts, you'll fall in love with yourself. But,
philosophy is what I discuss in blog, let's focus on the requirement of this website.

_I want to talk efficiently with my technology team._

- If I can't communicate my thoughts, they don't have a clue wtf this fucker even wants!
- If I can, but they don't have a clue how competent/incompetent their CEO is they'll approach me mostly as a noob PM.
- So, I would at least set the bare standards for interns, you don't get to write shittier code than me! Go and learn the basics.

But, what should I code? Coding something that I can't maintain makes no sense. _learnt the hard way, by killing my first
product in 2008, ouch_

Yeah, I anyways need to make it easier for myself to communicate what I think with the team, might as well code the whole thing
myself. So, even the tech team would have a good sense of how incompetent their CEO is. It's done then, **A personal website**.
Yeah, that sounds like an interesting challenge. Back to basics, do everything myself. Let's see what all
has changed in website hosting over the last decade. _I programmed in PHP/MySQL back in 2009_

Nobody told me much on Github back then ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ So, begin my grind from the very basics, and now I am typing this
in Markdown at ease. Nothing extraordinary, ground breaking research. Been a slow journey spread over an year. I can only dedicate couple of hours a week effectively for this. But, I am proud of where we have come.

Hopefully, you like 'nothingness' theme. I have even showcased my design skills *Dear designers, don't judge a painter by the
only painting you see*

Lots of work to do in places, even code quality is shitty at places, or maybe this is just me being defensive to compensate for
lack of a formal degree in computer science.

That's for you to decide!

Because it's all out in open. You may know what I know, and a clear communication will enable to expose what
I don't know, and hence we'll learn and grow together.

#### How this website works right now.

- I write drafts in my IDE in MD
- I publish them as posts in my local hexo, check for corrections.
- Then I push all the updates to this github repo.
- The public folder is hooked for copying stuff to S3 bucket directly somehow! (*Have to learn how to do*)
- Content is served through CDN as it's always static.
- Engagement. Right now no comments! *I am thinking if we can do anything better*
- **Content** You can send PR request on the actual post for any content corrections(grammatical, etc.)
- **Contribution** You can send any guest content, and if its around what we talk I'll take it. I am the boss though ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
- **Technology** If you would like to contribute anything to the code. Please do, I am always eager to learn. Thanks

Feel free to Fork. I would keep improving the design, content and features of my personal interaction with the world out there \M/
