            Personal Blog on varied topics of Philosophy, Physics,
            Entrepreneurship, Technology, Communication and all the curious
            things in the universe DV wants to talk about. He prefers to talk
            in a personal direct manner. Therefore, enjoy the stories
            that are shaping these shared thoughts. He does sometimes feels
            incapable with the tool of language at disposal. To avoid future pain
            he always tries to explain from as deep a perspective as possible.
            As noise on internet keeps increasing, it might seem counterproductive
            at first to spend time in understanding and explaining in depth.
            But, beauty is always in depth, and post you have truly felt it.
            You can continue with your job undeterred, at peace, always.
