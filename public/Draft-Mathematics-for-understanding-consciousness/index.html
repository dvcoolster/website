  <h1>Mathematics for Consciousness</h1>
<p>25th January 2018<p>
<br>
<p>Once upon a time I went batshit crazy and wondered if we can prove
singularity?</p>
<p>I did not start there, I just wanted to be a better entrepreneur. A first
principle attack on becoming a better leader ended up questioning
‘communication’. But, you cannot understand communication without understanding
the thought you desire to communicate. To understand human thought?</p>
<p>Welcome here my friends.</p>
<p>Today, almost everything around us is shaped or impacted by a human thought.
Civilizations, cities, transportation, internet, etc.</p>
<p>Yet, sometimes the most difficult and painful thing to do is just
communicating someone else your thought. Many times even to yourself.</p>
<p>Much has been said on the topic from a philosophical perspective. Eventually
though they convey the insufficiency of modern communication language as a tool
to understand self or universe.</p>
<p>Our attempt is to keep mathematics at the core and even if philosophical
outcomes are derived they maybe built through it. For example, we do know we are
all transformation of energy. So, are our thoughts.</p>
<p>2% of brain takes up 20%+ of energy!</p>
<p>In a sense, if there’s a blockchain that has all energy
transformations(transactions) since the big bang for every instant of time, till
now. That my dear friends is singularity right there for you! I have built
deeper on these lines, for some other time.</p>
<p>Let’s continue imagining an ever increasing blockchain originating at Big
Bang, and it has all the energy transformation that have occurred since to
present <em>‘Now’</em>.</p>
<p>At this <em>‘Now’</em>, each human can be considered a conscious node and his
<em>thoughts on future</em> a soft fork that may or may not be mined in the
Universal Blockchain. Quantum Nature. Anyways, these are directions I have been
exploring in our quest.</p>
<p>Doing meaningful research has been a challenge I have harbored for 2 years
now. Dedicating couple of hours a week I have studied the 80% low hanging parts
of quantum physics, but importantly gained confidence that there’s nothing we
can not learn. One thing I am sure about is in our journey to prove singularity,
I am geared up for next 80 years and would be grateful for any support.</p>
<p>I would like to inform and ask you one last thing before you give the draft a
read.</p>
<p>Only 1 out of 10 people get the core idea from doc. Do you think you
can?<br><em>Please remember your answer</em></p>
<p>Now, let’s take an attempt to understand the quantum nature of reality with a
simple thought that needs to be communicated.</p>

2017</a></p>
<p>I hope you have spent some time reading the document before proceeding. Feel
free to reach out, I am available and open for discussions on the research. Do
share your answer to my question.</p>
<p>Only 1 person could get the core idea from reading document, not because its
difficult, but because dvcoolster is learning to communicate. 9 out of 10 people
do get it when he explains it.</p>
<h4 id="Doubts"><a href="#Doubts" class="headerlink"
title="Doubts"></a>Doubts</h4><p>Dear quantum physicist, doesn’t human life feel
analogously similar to that of an electron inside atom?</p>
<p>Dear philosophers, once you understand the quantum nature in a simple
communication, can you not also see all puny human actions as a means of
communication throughout one’s life?</p>
<p>The question though remains, who are we communicating to?</p>
<p><em>Chuck it! let’s focus on What for now \z/</em></p>
