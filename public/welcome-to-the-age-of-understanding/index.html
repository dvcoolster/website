  <h1>Welcome to the Age of Understanding</h1>
<p>11th November 2017<p>
<br>
<p>Hi</p>
<p>Thanks for dropping by. As we begin to talk further with each other, I’ll
just lay down all of my thoughts for you. This way whenever we talk, you have a
sense of where I am coming from. As we exchange thoughts, working with our
knowledge, I am confident we shall build an exciting future.</p>
<p>In one of the other articles I talk about my personal reasons for starting to
blog. With this article I will give an overview of the overall blog, and
hopefully set out clear expectations.</p>
<p>From a broader perspective, we may observe that we’re going to power everyone
with the ability to speak with everyone else. Like me putting this blog out.</p>
<p>Rate of Content creation is already higher than any individual’s ability to
observe, understand and comprehend. It only looks like growing in the future.
Therefore,<br><em>Unless we begin to think deeper with focus, we are heading
towards a ‘Confused Age’ rather than ‘Information Age’</em></p>
<!-- It's important to understand because that is the source of 'Knowledge'. -->
<p>If I go around Silicon Valley, and ask what is the fuel of Information
age?<br><em>Data</em> is the largest voice. I personally would like to vouch for
another aspect of information, ‘Knowledge’.</p>
<p>Wiki says <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information" target="_blank"
rel="external">‘Information’</a>. <em>is the answer to a question of some kind.
It is thus related to ‘data’ and ‘knowledge’, as data represents values
attributed to parameters, and knowledge signifies understanding of real things
or abstract concepts. As it regards data, the information’s existence is not
necessarily coupled to an observer (it exists beyond an event horizon), while in
the case of knowledge, the information requires a cognitive observer.</em></p>
<p>We are creating data at an unprecedented rate. <a
href="http://www.internetlivestats.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Check
Live Stats</a> But, what are we understanding from all of this remains
questionable and varied across groups.</p>
<p>In the evolutionary process of our society, technology creates fear. It’s a
fact that people are losing their jobs, education system is failing, Governments
are closing borders, planet is being damaged by ourselves, people are afraid of
terrorism, income divide doesn’t look like getting any better.</p>
<p>Where are we heading to amidst all this? <strong>This fear of
Unknown</strong> forces each of us to keep our guard up.</p>
<p>There’s chaos all around, and unless we learn to focus, unless we learn to
build a solid strong foundation, the information will sway us away.</p>
<p>We must develop courage to walk right through the unknown, hold it by its
throat and bring it to <em>what we desire</em>, Unless that’s done we are not
among the best our species has witnessed. Then again, before all of that we must
focus and answer for ourselves,</p>
<p><strong>What do we desire? What do we fear?</strong></p>
<p>These will lead to philosophy, but a philosophy that can’t be practiced is
not of much use to us. Therefore, we are going to always make sure we come back
to actions we can do, miracles we can chase, and fears that we must conquer. As
an individual, as a company, as a country, and sometimes as a species.</p>
<p>Personally, when I imagine the year 2100, I think it’s too sexy to leave it
afar. I imagine an age of understanding, where we have made it extremely costly
for any violence. We’ve all realized that it’s profitable to think, to love, to
be honest.</p>
<p>It might sounds mystical right now, but overtime we shall try to make it more
practical. We are talking about future reality where,</p>
<p><em>We’ve realized it’s profitable to just be human!</em></p>
<p>It’s our job to use what separates us from every other animal, what
differentiates us from the machines we make, <em>Our Brain</em>.</p>
<p>It’s a tiring exercise to think, and I don’t believe we would force ourselves
to do it, unless we are forced to the corner?</p>
<p>I know people like to say Data is the fuel of Information age. But, I believe
‘Knowledge’ is an important component of it. I discuss this when we ask
fundamentally <em>What is any information?</em></p>
<p>Though, we can safely say, these same words will be understood in as many
ways as many people read it. Every individual who’s reading is unique, and
processes this data on his own.</p>
<p>Data is everywhere, from the light that enters our eyes, to the sounds we
hear, all of the subtleties we observe, spread over time, memories, biases, etc.
is processed by our brain that operates like a mathematical model, and produces
a ‘knowledge’/‘observation’ in our mind. A probabilistic quantum interpretation.
That interpretation shaped the macro reality all around us. Humans take actions
on this, and since we have already modified all of the environment around us,
its important we realize our power, and impact beyond all the data.</p>
<p>Communication, sharing of thoughts, origination of ‘knowledge’ in human
brains, etc. I have shared my views on layers of depth in other article. I also
talked about our limitation of expression is fundamental, because our thoughts
are quantum, but our language to express is binary. Language can never truly
express what we think/feel.</p>
<p>Regardless, if there can be any value in our thoughts, then a lot of it is
being wasted. Evidently, a lot is garbage quality, but how do we improve?</p>
<p>Wealth will always be unevenly distributed, market forces have done the most
for growth of human society than probably anything else. But, can their ever be
equality in opportunity?</p>
<p>I talk about this deeper later, but I have observed that we get most angry
when we feel unjust, helpless or lack of opportunity that somebody else
got.<br>On risk of being a fool very first day, I believe Information age
fundamentally depends upon we making sure that anyone and everyone can think
anywhere, act on it anywhere, and if there’s a possibility of a market out there
for his expression, is able to make his living of it. <em>Unless thinking
fundamentally helps me improve my living, why should I think? </em></p>
<p>How to think?<br>Meeting other cultures, reading books, traveling, exploring,
all of these things help us broaden our thoughts. I have not found a better way
to work on thoughts than discussing them fearlessly with the smartest people I
know. Therefore, thank you for your presence :)</p>
<p>Among all of this, at times I used to fear the power of ‘Facebook’, ‘Google’.
Will there ever be something that can challenge them?</p>
<p>As I write this, I have no doubt that the power of individual is on horizon.
In many sense, its already here. But, the friction is high, and only for the
lucky few among us, and as I was told by one of my friends. <em>“Removing
friction is the job of Startup”</em>. There are going to be multiple,
multi-Billion Dollar opportunities, in the industry of human expression. We
shall discuss them in other articles.</p>
<p>I hope I have been somewhat successful in arousing curiosity within you to
explore further, along-with a broad understanding of what to expect, and and why
to invest time in exploring.</p>
<p>There are directions you can go from here, do watch the video from 1981 that
explains towards the end fear of centralization, and thoughts from Steve Jobs on
how to make sure society is safe from it.</p>
<p>I will host the code for this website on Github, so that I can take Pull
Requests for errors and suggestions from everyone.<br>Till then, do let me know
whatever was incomprehensible for future readers.</p>
<p>Do remember, we are focussing hard, bringing in information from several
fields, and attempting to see a faint image of future. <em>A quote from Naval
around this would have been apt, couldn’t find it right now. I’ll close it in my
style</em></p>
<p>Thinking is difficult, communicating is tiresome. But, we must carry on
because,</p>
<p><em>Unless we can dream it, how can we even create it?</em></p>
