  <h1>Why Dvcoolster</h1>
<p>11th January 2018<p>
<br>
<p><em>I am lazy</em>.</p>
<p>I need to be reminded to keep working hard. My brain automatically optimizes
for the shortest effort for result. I set targets and goals accordingly. Test
the hypothesis of life, just like everyone else and live a happy life. It’s the
best way to live life imo, you can skip more than half the rat races society
throws at you, have time for your own introspection, be forced to choose your
own path while being calculative and game theoretic in your approach of spending
every moment.</p>
<p>What this doesn’t help though is in curbing your ego and is most famous for
ending up as ‘Unfulfilled potential’ aka ‘Wasted talent’.</p>
<p>The thing about genius or mastery is understanding the grind and having the
patience to go through it. Grind is everywhere, from sitting at a Poker Table,
building a company, chasing a passion, or simply investing. Unless, you learn
the depths of grind, accept it, slog for it, you would never appreciate the
quantum nature of reality. Humility in various successful people is common and
palpable because you can’t survive decades without understanding randomness of
life and acceptance of it.</p>
<p>For me, dvcoolster is a reminder of the basic fact that I’m late and behind
schedule in the world of internet.</p>
<p>I wish I could have my name as domain, but I was late to the internet.
Internet is the base of world’s largest organizations such as Google, Amazon and
Facebook.</p>
<p>In the year 2000, I was one of the biggest geeks in my place, Jodhpur, India.
There was no noise of a Dot-com bubble, anything people were talking about was a
Y2K bug. There wasn’t a Dot-com bubble to know about until it burst.</p>
<p>Any entrepreneur who hasn’t seen the dot-com burst can learn so many things
from the event that would be difficult to gather otherwise.</p>
<p>The importance of market is visible when you look at a multi decade horizon.
Locking down of capital when liquidity is available is another, ‘building a war
chest’ as they say. But keeping head down and building when the world is making
noise is the one I wish every entrepreneur understood better.</p>
<p>So, I embrace my identity online as ‘dvcoolster’. It is my earliest email,
one that everyone eventually changes.</p>
<p>Our identity will matter on the internet, and we will never have our names
here. Forget about having your name as domain, we will not have availability
even on general email services, etc. Good News! Name won’t matter, identity
will, earn it.</p>
<p>So, ‘dvcoolster’ reminds DV that there’s shit loads of work to do, challenges
to be conquered and a world to be build. You were late for the internet, it
might be upgrading itself, you won’t be able to forgive yourself, be there and
work hard.</p>
