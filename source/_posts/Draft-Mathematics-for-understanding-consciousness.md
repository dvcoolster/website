Once upon a time I went batshit crazy and wondered if we can prove singularity?

I did not start there, I just wanted to be a better entrepreneur. A first principle attack on becoming a better leader ended up questioning 'communication'. But, you cannot understand communication without understanding the thought you desire to communicate. To understand human thought?

Welcome here my friends.

Today, almost everything around us is shaped or impacted by a human thought. Civilizations, cities, transportation, internet, etc.

Yet, sometimes the most difficult and painful thing to do is just communicating someone else your thought. Many times even to yourself.

Much has been said on the topic from a philosophical perspective. Eventually though they convey the insufficiency of modern communication language as a tool to understand self or universe.

Our attempt is to keep mathematics at the core and even if philosophical outcomes are derived they maybe built through it. For example, we do know we are all transformation of energy. So, are our thoughts.

2% of brain takes up 20%+ of energy!

In a sense, if there's a blockchain that has all energy transformations(transactions) since the big bang for every instant of time, till now. That my dear friends is singularity right there for you! I have built deeper on these lines, for some other time.

Let's continue imagining an ever increasing blockchain originating at Big Bang, and it has all the energy transformation that have occurred since to present _'Now'_.

At this _'Now'_, each human can be considered a conscious node and his _thoughts on future_ a soft fork that may or may not be mined in the Universal Blockchain. Quantum Nature. Anyways, these are directions I have been exploring in our quest.

Doing meaningful research has been a challenge I have harbored for 2 years now. Dedicating couple of hours a week I have studied the 80% low hanging parts of quantum physics, but importantly gained confidence that there's nothing we can not learn. One thing I am sure about is in our journey to prove singularity, I am geared up for next 80 years and would be grateful for any support.

I would like to inform and ask you one last thing before you give the draft a read.

Only 1 out of 10 people get the core idea from doc. Do you think you can?
*Please remember your answer*

Now, let's take an attempt to understand the quantum nature of reality with a simple thought that needs to be communicated.

I hope you have spent some time reading the document before proceeding. Feel free to reach out, I am available and open for discussions on the research. Do share your answer to my question.

Only 1 person could get the core idea from reading document, not because its difficult, but because dvcoolster is learning to communicate. 9 out of 10 people do get it when he explains it.

#### Doubts
Dear quantum physicist, doesn't human life feel analogously similar to that of an electron inside atom?

Dear philosophers, once you understand the quantum nature in a simple communication, can you not also see all puny human actions as a means of communication throughout one's life?

The question though remains, who are we communicating to?

_Chuck it! let's focus on What for now \z/_
